# Collaborative design link list

To contribute and add new links, just give a fork (will create a copy of this project for you) and modify the `data/data.json` file with the change.

In the file, just follow the existing pattern:

```javascript
  {
    "title": "", // Link Title
    "url": "" // Link URL
  }
```

Remember to check if the final json file is valid and the area you want to add the link to, which can be:

* talks
* podcasts
* books
* courses
* freebies
* blogs
